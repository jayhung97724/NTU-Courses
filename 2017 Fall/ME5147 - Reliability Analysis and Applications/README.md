## Course Name

可靠度分析與應用
Reliability Analysis and Applications

## Semester

106-1

## Course Number

ME 5147

## Description

介紹簡單之可靠度工程學理，及其在工程領域裡可能之應用。除定性方面之描述外，因為可靠度量化之需要，會簡單介紹隨機變數、隨機程序、機率分佈、數據整理、統計推論等基本觀念。 

To introduce fundamental concepts and theories of reliability engineering and their applications. In addition to qualitative description, concepts of random variable, random process, probability distribution, random data analysis, statistical inference, etc. will be introduced. 

## Objective

讓學工程的學生在所學定性（Deterministic）量度之外，瞭解隨機（random）量度及其在可靠度工程方面之基本應用。 

To let students majoring in engineering know random other than deterministic analysis and learn its applications to reliability engineering.  

## Background

Calculus. Having concept of random variables and probability is preferable.
