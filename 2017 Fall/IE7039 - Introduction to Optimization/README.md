## Course Name

最佳化概論
Introduction to Optimization

## Semester

106-1

## Course Number

IE 7039

## Description

This course provides an introduction to optimization including the topics of mathematical preliminaries, linear programming, and advanced topics related to linear programming. The course also covers modeling of dynamic programming, integer programming, and nonlinear programming. The topic of linear programming is discussed at a greater depth than in introductory Operations Research (OR) courses, with an emphasis on its geometric interpretation. The knowledge of the first half of the course is extended to Integer Programming, Nonlinear Programming and Dynamic Programming at an introductory level to broaden the knowledge of optimization. This course is intended for Masters and PhD graduate students with prior knowledge of introductory OR and Calculus.

## Objective

It is designed for developing mathematical sophistication that is required in research work and it covers deterministic models and methods that are useful in solving problems of resource configuration, portfolio and mix planning, supply chain planning, scenario-based planning, risk management, operation scheduling, and policy design.

## Background

Introductory Operations Research and Calculus.

## Requirement

Homework will be assigned approximately once every two weeks. Homework will be posted on the course website with associated due dates. Late assignments will be accepted only in case of unavoidable occurrences. You are encouraged to discuss homework and learn from each other, but each person must submit his/her own work, unless the homework specifically indicates that you should work in groups.

Exams 1 and 2 are not cumulative. Exam 1 covers the topics from the first week to the Exam 1 week, and Exam 2 covers the topics after Exam 1 to the final week. All of exams of this course are closed-notes and closed-book, but you are allowed to bring one-page (A4-sized, double-sided) of "note" filled with equations or whatever you want in compressed writing or typing. You need to prepare the cheat sheet on your own. Copying from others is prohibited.
