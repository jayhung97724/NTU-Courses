Integer and Combinatorial Optimizationand

## Semester

105-2

## Course Number

IE 7020

## Description

The course covers fundamental integer programming techniques, including cutting plane methods, branch-and-bound enumeration, Bender’s decomposition, Lagrangain relaxation/decomposition, and heuristic/meta-heuristic programming. It also covers special techniques for solving well-known combinatorial problems, such as knapsack problem and the set covering/partition problem. This course will include the following topics:

1.	Introduction to Integer Programming (IP)
2.	IP modeling and applications
3.	The beale Tableau
4.	Using Linear programming to solve IP problems
5.	Cutting plane techniques
6.	Branch-and-Bound enumeration
7.	Search enumeration
8.	Bender’s Decomposition
9.	Lagrangian Relaxation/Decomposition
10.	Heuristic Algorithms
11.	Combinatorial problems: knapsack problem and the set covering/partition problem

## Objective

The course primarily focuses on study of Integer Programming and gives an overview of classical methods about problem formulations and solving. The goal of this course is to provide students some understanding such as why some problems are difficult to solve, how they can be reformulated to yield better results, and how effective different algorithms can be.

## Requirement

Your grade in the course will be determined by homework (20%), midterm exam (35%), final exam (30%) and project (15%). The requirements in details are described as follows: 

- Homework will be assigned every two weeks and the assignments need to be done independently. Late submissions are not accepted except a prior approval is received from the instructor.
- There are one midterm and one final exam.
- There is a final project which helps students comprehend the class material and apply to practical problems or real cases. The project may consist of a literature review for an application area, a research problem, or a computational study. 2 to 3 students (may vary upon the class size) form a group. Prepare a 25-min presentation and submit a report in the last class
